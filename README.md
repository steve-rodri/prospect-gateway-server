# Gateway Server

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg?cacheSeconds=2592000)

> Express Server to interface with Expo App

## Install

```sh
yarn
```

## Usage

### Have Doppler Installed to use Environment Variables

- [Getting Started with Doppler](https://docs.doppler.com/docs/getting-started)
- [How to Install Doppler](https://docs.doppler.com/docs/install-cli)

Using Brew:

```sh
# Prerequisite. gnupg is required for binary signature verification
brew install gnupg

# Next, install using brew (use `doppler update` for subsequent updates)
brew install dopplerhq/cli/doppler
```

Then run:

```sh
yarn env
```

To setup environment variables

### Have Docker Desktop installed to run the postgres db and supertokens instance

- [SuperTokens](https://supertokens.com)

Using Brew:

```sh
brew install homebrew/cask/docker
brew install docker-compose
```

The homebrew/cask/docker app may not work. In that case you can visit:

- [Docker Desktop Install Page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

Make sure docker desktop is running, then run:

```sh
yarn db:start
```

### Run Migrations and Seed Database

In a seperate shell/terminal, run:

```sh
yarn db:migrate
```

This will bootstrap the database with all tables and fields
defined in the /prisma/schema.prisma file and run any migrations
in prisma/migrations

Then run:

```sh
yarn db:seed
```

This will seed the database with fake data for development purposes.
We won't use this in production of course.

## Start the server

Run:

```sh
yarn start
```

or

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Prisma Studio

Run the following to launch a GUI for the database:

```sh
yarn db:studio
```

## tRPC Panel

Visit [http://localhost:5500/panel](http://localhost:5500/panel)
to view how the api works.

In order to use it, you will need to generate an access token on the client or
run the following command to create a new user:

- Be sure to substitute the email and password values for your own

```sh
curl -i --location --request POST 'http://localhost:5500/auth/signup' \
--header 'rid: thirdpartyemailpassword' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--data-raw '{ 
    "formFields": [ 
        { "id": "email", "value": "<YOUR_EMAIL>" },
        { "id": "password", "value": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>" },
        { "id": "name", "value": "" },
        { "id": "dateOfBirth", "value": "" },
        { "id": "phone", "value": "" }
    ] 
}'
```

This will create an access token that you can use to query the api.

 1. Copy the access token from the response headers. The header name should be "st-access-token".
 2. Go back to [http://localhost:5500/panel](http://localhost:5500/panel)
 and select headers at the top right.
 3. Add a new header. The key should be "Authorization" and the value should
 be "Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"

## Auth Dashboard

Use this command to create a new Admin User for the panel:

- Be sure to substitute your email and password again.

```sh
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:3567/recipe/dashboard/user' \
--header 'rid: dashboard' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"email": "<YOUR_EMAIL>","password": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>"}'
```

Visit [http://localhost:5500/auth/dashboard](http://localhost:5500/auth/dashboard)
and sign in using your credentials
